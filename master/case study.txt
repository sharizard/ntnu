- Nordic Semiconductor
- Telenor Trondheim
- Statoil
- Autronica
- Matiq (SKADA systemer - Life Cycle Management IIT)

Case Study Design
- Detect technical debt using static tools such as code smells and automated static analysis on code along with interviews. 
- Use models and metrics from existing papaers
- Modularity violations or design patterns and grime buildup
- AntiPatterns, rot (when design pattern is not suitable for changes)
- Look for symptoms on higher level abstraction of architecture (compoentns, connectors, concerns)

How to
- Prestudy/review the architecture
- Identify violations, debt etc.
- Conduct interviews, questionnaires about findings

Identify TD:
- Code smells to discover breaches in object-oriented design practices
- Use of tools
