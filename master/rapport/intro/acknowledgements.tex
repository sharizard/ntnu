This work has been supervised by Carl-Fredrik Sørensen at the Norwegian Univserity of Science and Technology (NTNU). I would like to express my sincere thanks to him for giving me the opportunity to work on this exciting project and for his invaluable guidance throughout the process. Without his time and invaluable feedback, this work would not have been complete. 

I would like to show my gratitude to Ingar Kulbrandstad from Autronica for providing the case study. I would also like to thank Øyvind Teig from Autronica for helpful proof-reading and grammar correction during the final phases of this thesis. 

Lastly, I would like to thank my family and friends that have supported me all the way throughout my studies.
