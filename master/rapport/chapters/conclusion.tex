\chapter{Conclusion}
This research presents the result of a case study that has investigated design debt in embedded systems. The purpose of this study was to identify design debt in embedded systems by measuring object-oriented metrics and detecting code smells. The results show that **. 

\section{Future Work}
Based on the results from this thesis, we outline some possibilites for future research.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Measuring other object-oriented metrics
	\item Implementation of tools which can suggest refactoring options
	\item A deeper study on multiple release version of a system to compare the evolution of metrics and patterns over time.
	\item Study design pattern
\end{itemize}
