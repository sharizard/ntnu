\chapter{Research Methodology}

This chapter describes the research methodology that has been used in this thesis to answer the research questions. 

\section{Empirical Strategies}
According to Wohlin\cite{Wohlin:2000:ESE:330775}, empirical studies follows two types of research paradigms; the qualitative, and the quantitative paradigm. Qualitative research is concerned with studying objects in their natural setting\cite{Wohlin:2000:ESE:330775}. It is based on non-numeric data found in sources as interview tapes, documents, or developers' model. Quantitative research is concerned with quantifying a relationship or to compare two or more groups\cite{Wohlin:2000:ESE:330775}. It is based on collecting numerical data. 

Empirical research can be Oates\cite{Oates:2006:RIS:1202299} presents six different research strategies; survey, design and creation, case study, experimentation, action research, and ethnography. 



Present different research strategies; survey, design and creation, case study, experimentation, action research, and ethnography



\section{Research Design}

- Open source systems
- Object oriented

Data generation: Documents

Type: Descriptive, exploratory

Steps:
- Pre study (state of the art)
- Case study design
- Preparation for data collecton
- Collecting data
- Analysis of data
- Discussing the data


Strategy:
- Literature review, and experience and motivation -> research questions -> case study -> documents -> qualitative/quantitative



\section{Case Study}
