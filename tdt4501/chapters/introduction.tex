\section{Motivation and background}




Today, hardware and software based systems, further known as embedded systems, are growing rapidly. Ranging from microprosessors in cellphones to sensors in cars and surveillance systems, embedded computing is becoming a big part of our lives. With the rapid growth of embedded systems, we clearlysee that most future computing systems will be embedded systems\cite{wolfmadsen-2000}. With the new era of Internet of Things, more and more embedded systems are getting a networked interconnection. This leads to a distributed network of devices communicating with other devices as well as human beings. Gartner has estimated that in 2020, 25 billion connected "things" will be in use\cite{gartner}. To provide more functionality, multiple components are combined together with embedded systems. However, as the complexity of embedded system increases, the ability to maintain the quality of such systems becomes more difficult. Combination of multiple components leads to higher costs of verifying additional software and many fails to test the product properly and deliver a reliable product. Companies must often recall their products. If they could catch these software defects earlier in teh system design process, they would have saved a lot of money. Embedded systems also has long lifetime and its important to find out how to make decisisions so future maintenance and evolution has low cost as possible. Technical debt is a big factor in embedded systems as developers might not be available years after implementation.

Technical debt is a rising problem. It is estimated that the total debt in 2015 will be around 1 billion dollars. That is the double of the amount technical debt in 2010.


\section{Goals and Research Questions}
The main objective of this project is to find out how software in embedded systems are developed, managed, and how much focus there are on maintenance and evolution of software over time. The reason for this is that embedded systems usually has long lifetime, and it is important to find out how such systems are managed because the architecture and design decisions are usually made long time ago and these people might not be available. How are decisions taken.

The main question for this project is (ikke ferdig enda): 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hva slags teknikker finnes til h√•ndtering av TG, og hvordan blir disse brukt?
	\item Hvordan er TG relatert til evolusjon og maintenance?
\end{itemize}

\section{Research method}
This research will consist of a sequence of activities. The model of the research process defined in the book "Researching Information Systems Something" will be applied for this project. This model says that for each research question, one strategy is needed with one or more data generation methods. A dataanalysis will be done after generation in form of quantitative or qualitative in order to draw a conclusion. This is to answer the research questions.

To answer our research questions, a litterature review will be carried out in order to get familiar with the area of study. After getting an overview of the research field, one or more research questions will be defined. To answer the research questions, one strategy will be defined, in this case a case study/survey, following an interview as data generation method.
