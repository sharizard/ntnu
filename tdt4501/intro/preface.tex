\section*{Preface}
This report has been written during autumn 2015, as a part of the course TDT4501, Specializion Project for Software Engineering, at Norwegian University of Science and Technology. 

This work was supervised by Dr. Carl-Fredrik SÃ¸rensen. He helped me very much by providing insightful input and valuable feedback during the period. He also helped me with providing most names of IT companies in Trondheim along with their contact details.

We have performed four interviews during this period. We would like to thank all the respondents who took time to participate in the interview.
